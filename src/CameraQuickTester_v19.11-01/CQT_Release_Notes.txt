v19.11-01
------------------------------------------------
ENHANCEMENT: Added support for MacOS (experimental, may be removed in future releases).
ENHANCEMENT: Linux: System Info routine now collects info about USB autosuspend and usbfs size
ENHANCEMENT: If the camera device was removed, the advice log now will show at what step this happened.
ENHANCEMENT: Corrected the order of test results in final report to match the order in which they ran (ie: events test).
ENHANCEMENT: Now shows the location of the working directory at end of program, so it's easy to find the result files.
EHNANCEMENT: Tested on upcoming Pylon 6.0.1.
 
------------------------------------------------
v19.10-01
------------------------------------------------
ENHANCEMENT: The Linux version now also creates a zip file with all test results like the Windows version.
ENHANCEMENT: The camera events test now only requires the camera to support either the FrameStart event or the ExposureEnd event. Previously it required both.

------------------------------------------------
v19.09-01
------------------------------------------------
ENHANCEMENT: Added support for Pylon 6.0
ENHANCEMENT: Added support for Ace2 Design-In Samples
ENHANCEMENT: Better support for older cameras that have AcquisitionStart trigger instead of FrameStart.
ENHANCEMENT: Cleaned up 'pretest info' by removing line about pfs file location. This was not needed since all file are in same folder.
BUGFIX     : Previous version gave 'wrong firmware' false alarm with POL cameras. This has been fixed.
BUGFIX     : Previous version could try reading an unreadable node when checking sequencer setting. This has been fixed.

------------------------------------------------
v19.08-01
------------------------------------------------
ENHANCEMENT: All files generated by CQT are named after the testing step they come from.
ENHANCEMENT: Advice file now also contains the condensed pass/fail test report.
ENHANCEMENT: PC time is now logged when a failed image is detected, to aid in investigations (ie: fails may be caused by some other PC event).
ENHANCEMENT: Better support for testing cameras with Sequencer feature enabled. ie. advice now given in settings analyzer step.
ENHANCEMENT: Improved scanning of nodemaps when saving settings to PC and comparing them to default settings.
ENHANCEMENT: Updated device detection test to support the new name for USB 3.1, "USB 3.2".
BUGFIX     : If the grab test failed, the 'duration of test' timer was incorrect. This is now fixed.

------------------------------------------------
v19.06-21
------------------------------------------------
ENHANCEMENT: Minor change to pre-test quick-search to support longer camera names.
BUGFIX     : Sequencer check was using wrong node name. This is now fixed.

------------------------------------------------
v19.06-01
------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURE: Pre-Test Quick-Search for devices: Helpful for finding the serial number when the camera can be detected, but not seen (eg buried in a machine)
NEW FEATURE: Basic Live View Step: This can help the user manually evaluate things like focus and image quality.
ENHANCEMENT: New build folder structure to make finding the right exe easier for the user.
ENHANCEMENT: changed batch and script file names to avoid user confusion.
ENHANCEMENT: added readme documentation
ENHANCEMENT: Added support for USB 3.0's new name "USB 3.2 Gen 1"
ENHANCEMENT: Advice log is now also offered as a separate file.
ENHANCEMENT: Grab test now shows warning and adds advice if it detects a Grab Engine thread priorty less than the recommended realtime class.
ENHANCEMENT: Sequencer Check: If the sequencer is enabled, read/write access to a lot of features is disabled. So for CQT testing, we will disable the sequencer during testing.
ENHANCEMENT: Better and more clear analysis of NIC settings when using GigE cameras and especially the Basler Performance Driver (Basler GigE Vision Adapter).
ENHANCEMENT: Moved Analysis of host controllers test to earlier in the routine, just after device detection, because we don't need a full connection to the camera for this.
ENHANCEMENT: Clarified advice log note that temp test is skipped when the camera does not have a temperature sensor.
ENHANCEMENT: In rare cases, dumping the usb topology can take ~60sec. Added a notice about this and a spinline to show the user CQT is not frozen.
BUGFIX     : Camera Events test: Previously, older cameras that only supported acquisitionstart trigger would fail this test. This has been fixed.
